## UI SHOWCASE
A showcase of UI components build with **React** and **styled-components**.

## Purpose
Provide components used in the day to day development. The main purpose is to avoid the need to download UI libraries with a very opinionated style and providing one catalog of components to reach when needed.

## How to use
Just browse through the available components listed [here](https://imaginary-cloud.github.io/ui-show-case/?path=/story/badge--welcome) and copy what you need without installing anything else.
